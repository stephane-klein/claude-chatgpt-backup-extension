## 📥 Installation

### From Firefox Add-on Store
1. Download the extension from the [Firefox Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/claude-ai-chat-backup/)
2. Click on "Add to Firefox" to install the extension
3. No additional configuration needed - the extension works immediately

### As a Temporary Add-on (for development/testing)
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine
2. Build the extension using `npm run build` (or use the pre-built files)
3. In Firefox, navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
4. Click on "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Navigate to the extension directory and select the `manifest.json` file
6. The extension will be loaded for the current session (will be removed when Firefox is closed)

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before using the extension, make sure you:

1. **Are logged in** to your [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) account (for Claude backups)
2. **Are logged in** to your [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) account (for ChatGPT backups)

The extension uses your existing authenticated sessions to access the APIs, so it **cannot work** if you're not already logged in.

## 🚀 Usage

### Claude.ai Backup

1. Navigate to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Click on the HumainLabs extension icon in your Firefox toolbar
3. Choose either:
   - "Backup Current Claude Chat" to save only the current conversation
   - "Backup All Claude Conversations" to save all your conversations

### ChatGPT Backup

1. Navigate to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and open a conversation
2. Click on the HumainLabs extension icon in your Firefox toolbar
3. Choose either:
   - "Backup Current ChatGPT Chat" to save only the current conversation

For both services, you'll be prompted to choose where to save the JSON file. The file will be named with the chat title and timestamp.
